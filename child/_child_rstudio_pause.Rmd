1. You can view costs and make changes to your cloud environments from the panel on the far right of the page.  If you don’t see this panel, you may need to scroll to the right.  Running environments will have a green dot, and paused environments will have an orange dot.

    ```

1. When the environment is paused, an orange dot will be displayed next to the RStudio icon.  If you hover over the icon, you will see that it is paused, and has a small ongoing cost as long as it is paused.  When you’re ready to resume working, you can do so by clicking the RStudio icon and clicking Resume.
