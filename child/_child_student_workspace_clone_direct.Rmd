:::{.warning}
This **will not work** until your instructor has given you permission to spend money to "rent" the computers that will power your analyses (by adding you to a "Billing Project").
:::

On AnVIL, you access files and computers through **Workspaces**.  Each Workspace functions almost like a mini code laboratory - it is a place where data can be examined, stored, and analyzed. The first thing we want to do is to copy or “clone” a Workspace to create a space for you to experiment.  This will give you access to

- the files you will need (data, code)
- the computing environment you will use

:::{.notice}
**Tip**
At this point, it might make things easier to open up a new window in your browser and split your screen. That way, you can follow along with this guide on one side and execute the steps on the other.

To clone an AnVIL Workspace:

1. Go to the Workspace by clicking this link: `r AnVIL_module_settings$workspace_link`.
    
1. Clone the workspace by clicking the teardrop button (![teardrop button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhudsl/AnVIL_Template/main/child/child_assets/teardrop_button.png){width=25px}). Select "Clone". See the screenshot below on a different Workspace:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.alt='Screenshot showing the teardrop button. The button has been clicked revealing the "clone" option. The Clone option and the teardrop button are highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a5Da6qX9BG7Q_6XAz7MvlDyWTvssm2hWwuo1WFJXb_0/edit#slide=id.g117abafa453_0_577")
    ```

1. You will see a popup box appear, asking you to configure your Workspace
    a. Give your Workspace clone a name by adding an underscore ("_") and your name. For example, \"`r AnVIL_module_settings$clone_name`\".
    a. Select the Billing Project `r AnVIL_module_settings$billing_project`.
    a. Leave the bottom two boxes as-is.
    a. Click “CLONE WORKSPACE”.
    
    See the screenshot below on a different Workspace:
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.alt='Screenshot showing the "clone a workspace" popout. The Workspace name, Billing Project, and Clone Workspace button have been filled in and highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a5Da6qX9BG7Q_6XAz7MvlDyWTvssm2hWwuo1WFJXb_0/edit#slide=id.g17144dbacd0_0_352")
    ```

1. The new Workspace should now show up under https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces. This is your own copy of the Workspace to work in.

```{r, include = FALSE}
AnVIL_module_settings <<- NULL
```
