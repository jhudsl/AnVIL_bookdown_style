Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Billing Project. All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project (regardless of who conducted it). If you are working with protected data, you can set the Authorization Domain to limit who can be added to your Workspace. Note that the Authorization Domain cannot be changed after the Workspace is created (i.e. there is no way to make this Workspace shareable with a larger audience in the future). Workspaces by default are only visible to people you specifically share them with. Authorization domains add an extra layer of enforcement over privacy, but by nature make sharing more complicated. We recommend using Authorization Domains in cases where it is extremely important and/or legally required that the data be kept private (e.g. protected patient data, industry data). For data you would merely prefer not be shared with the world, we recommend relying on standard Workspace sharing permissions rather than Authorization Domains, as Authorization Domains can make future collaborations, publications, or other sharing complicated. Click “CREATE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces. 3.2 Background Highlighting for Borrowed Chapters You can use the borrowed_chunk custom div block to highlight borrowed content or any other content you choose.

If a Workspace has been shared with you ahead of time, it will appear in “MY WORKSPACES”. You can clone a Workspace that was shared with you to perform your own analyses. In the screenshot below, no Workspaces have been shared. If a Workspace hasn’t been shared with you, navigate to the “FEATURED” or “PUBLIC” Workspace tabs. Use the search box to find the Workspace you want to clone. Click the teardrop button on the far right next to the Workspace you want to clone. Click “Clone”. You can also clone the Workspace from the Workspace Dashboard instead of the search results. You will see a popup box appear. Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Terra Billing Project. All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project (regardless of who conducted it). Remember that each Workspace should have its own Billing Project. If you are working with protected data, you can set the Authorization Domain to limit who can be added to your Workspace.

Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the plus icon near the top of left of the page. Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Billing Project. All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project (regardless of who conducted it).

Click “CREATE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces. 4.3 Open a Workspace Launch Terra In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. You are automatically directed to the “My Workspaces” tab. Here you can see any Workspaces that have been shared with you, along with your permission level. Reader means you can open the Workspace and see everything, but can’t do any computations or make any edits. Writer means you can run computations, which will charge costs to the Workspace’s Billing Project. Writers can also make edits to the Workspace. Owner is similar to Writer, but also allows you to control who can access the Workspace. Click on the name of a Workspace to open it. Opening and viewing a Workspace does not cost anything. When you open a Workspace, you are directed to the Workspace Dashboard. This generally has a description of the Workspace contents, as well as some useful details about the Workspace itself. From here you can navigate through the different tabs of the Workspace, and if you have sufficient permission, you can start running analyses. If you are only a Reader, you may need to “clone” (make your own copy) of the Workspace before you can start working. 4.4 Share a Workspace Launch Terra In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the name of the Workspace to open the Workspace. Opening a Workspace does not cost anything. Certain activities in the Workspace (such as running an analysis) will charge to the Workspace’s Billing Project. Workspace management (e.g. adding and removing members, editing the description) does not cost money. Click the circle with 3 dots on the right hand side to open the Workspace management menu. Click “Share” Enter the email address of the user you want to share the Workspace with. This must be the address associated with the account they are using to access Terra. Choose their permission level. Remember that all activity in the Workspace will be charged to the Workspace’s Billing Project, regardless of who conducts it, so only add members as “Writers” or “Owners” if they should be charging to the Workspace’s Billing Project. “Readers” can view all parts of the Workspace but cannot make edits or run analyses (i.e. they cannot spend money). They can also clone their own copy of the Workspace where they can conduct activity on their own Billing Project. Click “Save”. The user should now be able to see the Workspace when logged in to Terra.

Make sure to use the same Google account ID you use to log into Terra. If you are a first time user, don’t forget to claim your free credits! If you haven’t been to the console before, once you accept the Terms of Service you will be greeted with an invitation to “Try for Free.” Follow the instructions to sign up for a Billing Account and get your credits. Choose “Individual Account”. This “billing account” is just for managing billing, so you don’t need to be able to add your lab members. You will need to give either a credit card or bank account for security. Don’t worry! You won’t be billed until you explicitly turn on automatic billing. You can view and edit your new Billing Account, by selecting “Billing” from the left-hand menu, or going direction to the billing console console.cloud.google.com/billing Clicking on the Billing Account name will allow you to manage the account, including accessing reports, setting alerts, and managing payments and billing. We will cover account management in greater detail below. At any point, you can create additional Billing Accounts using the Create Account button. We recommend creating a new Billing Account for each funding source. 5.2 Add Terra to Google Billing Account This gives Terra permission to create projects and send charges to the Google Billing Account, and must be done by an administrator of the Google Billing Account. Terra needs to be added as a “Billing Account User”: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Navigate to Billing You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account rather than a list of your Billing Accounts, you can get back to the list by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Check the box next to the Billing Account you wish to add Terra to, click “ADD MEMBER”. Enter terra-billing@terra.bio in the text box. In the drop-down menu, mouse over Billing, then choose “Billing Account User”. Click “SAVE”. 5.3 Add Members to Google Billing Account Anyone you wish to add to the Billing Account will need their own Google ID. To add a member to a Billing Project: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Navigate to Billing You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account rather than a list of your Billing Accounts, you can get back to the list by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Check the box next to the Billing Account you wish to add a member to, click “ADD MEMBER”. Enter their Google ID in the text box. In the drop-down menu, mouse over Billing, then choose the appropriate role. Click “SAVE”. 5.4 Set Alerts for Google Billing Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using the Google ID associated with your Google Cloud projects. Open the dropdown menu on the top left and click on Billing. You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (and it’s not the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Click on the name of the Billing Account you want to set alerts for. In the left-hand menu, click “Budgets &amp; alerts”. Click the “Create Budget” tab. Enter a name for your budget, and then choose which projects you want to monitor. Then click “Next”. For Budget Type, select “Specified amount”. Enter the total budget amount for the month (you will set alerts at different thresholds in the next step). Click “Next” (do not click “Finish”). Enter the threshold amounts where you want to receive an alert. We recommend starting with 50% and 90%. You can set other alerts if you prefer. Check the box for “Email alerts to billing admins and users”, then click “Finish”. Now you (as the owner and admin), along with anyone you added with admin or user privileges (e.g. lab managers) will receive alerts when your lab members reach the specified spending thresholds. These emails will be sent to the Gmail accounts associated with the Billing Account. You can edit your budgets at any time by going to Billing &gt; Budgets &amp; alerts, and clicking on the name of the budget you want to edit. 5.5 View Spend for Google Billing You can always check your current spend through the Google Billing console, but remember There is a reporting delay (~1 day), so you cannot immediately see what an analysis cost Costs are reported at the level of Workspaces, so if there are multiple people using a Workspace, you will not be able to determine which of them was responsible for the charges. The Google Billing console displays information by Billing Account. To view spending: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using the Google ID associated with your Google Cloud projects. Open the dropdown menu on the top left and click on Billing. You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (and it’s not the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Click on the name of the Billing Account for the project you want to view. Look at the top of the Overview tab to see your month-to-date spending. Scroll further down the Overview tab to show your top projects. Click on the Reports tab to see more detailed information about each of your projects. This is probably the most useful tab for exploring costs of individual projects over time. Click on the Cost table tab to obtain a convenient table of spending per project. 5.6 Create Terra Billing Project Launch Terra and sign in with your Google account. If this is your first time logging in to Terra, you will need to accept the Terms of Service. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Billing”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click the arrow next to your name to expand the menu, then click “Billing”. You can also navigate there directly with this link: https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing On the Billing page, click the “+ CREATE” button to create a new Billing Project. If prompted, select the Google account to use. If prompted, give Terra permission to manage Google Cloud Platform billing accounts. Enter a unique name for your Terra Billing Project and select the appropriate Google Billing Account. The name of the Terra Billing Project must: Only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens Start with a lowercase letter Not end with a hyphen Be between 6 and 30 characters The page doesn’t always update as soon as the Billing Project is created. If it’s been a couple of minutes and you don’t see a change, try refreshing the page. 5.7 Add Member to Terra Billing Project Launch Terra and sign in with your Google account. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Billing”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click the arrow next to your name to expand the menu, then click “Billing”. You can also navigate there directly with this link: https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “Owned by You” and find the Billing Project. If you do not see the Billing Project in this list, then you are not an Owner and do not have permission to add members. Click on the name of the Billing Project. Click on the “Members” tab to view and manage members. Then click the “Add User” button. Enter the email address of the user or group you’d like to add the the Billing Project. If adding an individual, make sure to enter the account that they use to access AnVIL. If adding a Terra Group, use the Group email address, which can be found on the Terra Group management page. If this user or group will need to add and remove other users of the Billing Project, check the Owner box. Otherwise leave it unchecked. It’s often a good idea to have at least one other Owner of a Billing Project in order to avoid getting locked out, in case the original owner leaves or loses access to their account. Click “ADD USER”. You should now see the user or group listed in the Billing Project members, along with the appropriate role. They should now be able to use the Billing Project to fund work on AnVIL. If you need to remove members or modify their roles, you can do so at any time by clicking the teardrop button next to their name.

Open your Workspace, and click on the “NOTEBOOKS” tab. Next, click on “Create a Cloud Environment for Galaxy”. You should see a popup window on the right side of the screen. Click on “NEXT” and “CREATE” to keep all settings as-is. This will take 8-10 minutes. When it is done, click “LAUNCH GALAXY”. 7.4 Navigating Galaxy Notice the three main sections. Tools - These are all of the bioinformatics tool packages available for you to use. The Main Dashboard - This contains flash messages and posts when you first open Galaxy, but when we are using data this is the main interface area. History - When you start a project you will be able to see all of the documents in the project in the history. Now be aware, this can become very busy. Also the naming that Galaxy uses is not very intuitive, so you must make sure that you label your files with something that makes sense to you. On the welcome page, there are links to tutorials. You may try these out on your own. If you want to try a new analysis this is a good place to start. 7.5 Deleting Galaxy Once you are done with your activity, you’ll need to shut down your Galaxy cloud environment. This frees up the cloud resources for others and minimizes computing cost. The following steps will delete your work, so make sure you are completely finished at this point. Otherwise, you will have to repeat your work from the previous steps. Return to AnVIL, and find the Galaxy logo that shows your cloud environment is running. Click on this logo: Next, click on “DELETE ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS”: Finally, select “Delete everything, including persistent disk”. Make sure you are done with the activity and then click “DELETE”. 7.6 Video overview on using RStudio Here is a video tutorial that describes the basics of using RStudio on AnVIL. 7.6.1 Objectives Start compute for your RStudio environment Tour RStudio on AnVIL Stop compute to minimize expenses 7.6.2 Slides The slides for this tutorial are are located here. 7.7 Launching RStudio AnVIL is very versatile and can scale up to use very powerful cloud computers. It’s very important that you select a cloud computing environment appropriate to your needs to avoid runaway costs. If you are uncertain, start with the default settings; it is fairly easy to increase your compute resources later, if needed, but harder to scale down. Note that, in order to use RStudio, you must have access to a Terra Workspace with permission to compute (i.e. you must be a “Writer” or “Owner” of the Workspace). Open Terra - use a web browser to go to anvil.terra.bio In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the name of your Workspace. You should be routed to a link that looks like: https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/&lt;billing-project&gt;/&lt;workspace-name&gt;. Click on the cloud icon on the far right to access your Cloud Environment options. In the dialogue box, click the “Settings” button under RStudio You will see some details about the default RStudio cloud environment, and a list of costs because it costs a small amount of money to use cloud computing. If you are uncertain about what you need, the default configuration is a reasonable, cost-conservative choice. It is fairly easy to increase your compute resources later, if needed, but harder to scale down. Click the “Create” button. Otherwise, click “CUSTOMIZE” to modify the environment for your needs. The dialogue box will close and you will be returned to your Workspace. You can see the status of your cloud environment by hovering over the RStudio logo. It will take a few minutes for Terra to request computers and install software. When your environment is ready, its status will change to “Running”. Click on the RStudio logo to open a new dialogue box that will let you launch RStudio. Click the launch icon to open RStudio. This is also where you can pause, modify, or delete your environment when needed. You should now see the RStudio interface with information about the version printed to the console. 7.8 Touring RStudio Next, we will be using RStudio and the package Glimma to create interactive plots. See this vignette for more information. The Bioconductor team has created a very useful package to programmatically interact with Terra and Google Cloud. Install the AnVIL package. It will make some steps easier as we go along. You can now quickly install precompiled binaries using the AnVIL package’s install() function. We will use it to install the Glimma package and the airway package. The airway package contains a SummarizedExperiment data class. This data describes an RNA-Seq experiment on four human airway smooth muscle cell lines treated with dexamethasone. {Note: for some of the packages, you will have to install packaged from the CRAN repository, using the install.packages() function. The examples will show you which install method to use.} &lt;img src=&quot;07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_56.png&quot; title=&quot;Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted.&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted.&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt; Load the example data. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot is frequently used to explore differences in samples. When this data is MDS transformed, the first two dimensions explain the greatest variance between samples, and the amount of variance decreases monotonically with increasing dimension. The following code will launch a new window where you can interact with the MDS plot. Change the colour_by setting to “groups” so you can easily distinguish between groups. In this data, the “group” is the treatment. You can download the interactive html file by clicking on “Save As”. You can also download plots and other files created directly in RStudio. To download the following plot, click on “Export” and save in your preferred format to the default directory. This saves the file in your cloud environment. You should see the plot in the “Files” pane. Select this file and click “More” &gt; “Export” Select “Download” to save the file to your local machine. 7.9 Pausing RStudio The upper right corner reminds you that you are accruing cloud computing costs. You should minimize charges when you are not performing an analysis. You can do this by clicking on “Stop cloud environment”. This will release the CPU and memory resources for other people to use. Note that your work will be saved in the environment and continue to accrue a very small cost. This work will be lost if the cloud environment gets deleted. If there is anything you would like to save permanently, it’s a good idea to copy it from your compute environment to another location, such as the Workspace bucket, GitHub, or your local machine, depending on your needs. 7.10 Deleting RStudio Stopping your cloud environment only pauses your work. When you are ready to delete the cloud environment, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to “Update cloud environment”. Click on “Delete Environment Options”. If you are certain that you do not need the data and configuration on your disk, you should select “Delete everything, including persistent disk”. If there is anything you would like to save, open the compute environment and copy the file(s) from your compute environment to another location, such as the Workspace bucket, GitHub, or your local machine, depending on your needs. Select “DELETE”. "],["student-instructions.html", "Chapter 8 Student instructions 8.1 Student Account Setup 8.2 Student instructions for cloning a Workspace 8.3 Student instructions for launching RStudio", " Chapter 8 Student instructions Modules aimed at students in a course or workshop. 8.1 Student Account Setup In order to run your analyses, you will use the AnVIL cloud computing platform, so that you do not need to install everything on your own computer. The AnVIL (Analysis Visualization and Informatics Lab-space) platform is specially designed for analyzing biological data, and is used by scientists doing all sorts of biological research. AnVIL in a nutshell Behind the scenes, AnVIL relies on Google Cloud Platform to provide computing infrastructure. Basically, AnVIL lets you “rent” computers from Google (remotely). Whenever you run an analyses on AnVIL, it actually runs on one of Google’s computers, and AnVIL lets you see the results in your browser. AnVIL uses Terra to provide many computational tools useful for biological data analysis, such as RStudio, Galaxy, and Jupyter Notebooks. Terra takes care of installing these tools on Google’s computers, so that you can just start using them. 8.1.1 Create Google Account First, you will need to set up a (free) Google account. If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing AnVIL, create one now. Alternatively, if you would like to create a Google account that is associated with an existing non-Gmail email address, you can follow these instructions. 8.1.2 Log In to Terra Next, make sure you can log in to Terra – you will use Terra to perform computations on AnVIL. You can access Terra by going to anvil.terra.bio, or by clicking the link on the AnVIL home page. Open Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. 8.1.3 Share Username Finally, make sure your instructor has your Google account username (e.g. myname@gmail.com), so they can give you access to everything you need. Make sure there are no typos! If you have multiple Google accounts, make sure you give them the username that you will be using to access AnVIL It is very important that you share the Google account you will be using to access AnVIL with with your instructor! Otherwise, the instructor cannot add you to Billing Projects or Workspaces, and you will be unable to proceed with your assignments. 8.2 Student instructions for cloning a Workspace These instructions can be customized to a specific workspace by setting certain variables before running cow::borrow_chapter(). If these variables have not been set, reasonable defaults are provided (e.g. “ask your instructor”). 8.2.1 With no variables set: This will not work until your instructor has given you permission to spend money to “rent” the computers that will power your analyses (by adding you to a “Billing Project”). On AnVIL, you access files and computers through Workspaces. Each Workspace functions almost like a mini code laboratory - it is a place where data can be examined, stored, and analyzed. The first thing we want to do is to copy or “clone” a Workspace to create a space for you to experiment. This will give you access to the files you will need (data, code) the computing environment you will use Tip At this point, it might make things easier to open up a new window in your browser and split your screen. That way, you can follow along with this guide on one side and execute the steps on the other. To clone an AnVIL Workspace: Open Terra - use a web browser to go to anvil.terra.bio In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. You are automatically directed to the “MY WORKSPACES” tab. Here you can see any Workspaces that have been shared with you, along with your permission level. Depending on how your instructor has set things up, you may or may not see any Workspaces in this tab. Locate the Workspace specified by your instructor. (The images below show the SARS-CoV-2-Genome Workspace as an example, but you should look for the Workspace specified by your instructor.) If it has been shared with you ahead of time, it will appear in “MY WORKSPACES”. Otherwise, select the “PUBLIC” tab. In the top search bar, type the Workspace name specified by your instructor. You can also go directly to the Workspace by clicking this link: ask your instructor. Clone the workspace by clicking the teardrop button (). Select “Clone”. Or, if you have opened the Workspace, you can find the teardrop button on the top right of the Workspace. You will see a popup box appear, asking you to configure your Workspace Give your Workspace clone a name by adding an underscore (“_“) and your name. For example, \"ExampleWorkspace_Firstname_Lastname\". Select the Billing Project provided by your instructor. Leave the bottom two boxes as-is. Click “CLONE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under “MY WORKSPACES”. You now have your own copy of the Workspace to work in. 8.2.2 With variables set: This will not work until your instructor has given you permission to spend money to “rent” the computers that will power your analyses (by adding you to a “Billing Project”).

There are several other general purpose modules that may also be useful for students (e.g. Pausing RStudio, Deleting RStudio) that can be found in other chapters of this book. The following instructions can be customized by setting certain variables before running cow::borrow_chapter(). Developers should create these variables as a list AnVIL_module_settings. The following variables can be provided: audience = Defaults to general, telling them to use the default RStudio settings. If audience is set to student, it gives more specific instructions. docker_image = Optional, it will tell them to open the customization dialogue and direct them on how to set the image. startup_script = Optional, it will tell them to open the customization dialogue and direct them on how to set the script. 8.3.1 Using default RStudio environment: AnVIL is very versatile and can scale up to use very powerful cloud computers.

"],["why-anvil.html", "Chapter 9 Why AnVIL 9.1 Why AnVIL for Instructors?", " Chapter 9 Why AnVIL Modules describing why AnVIL is useful for different personas. 9.1 Why AnVIL for Instructors? You may be wondering if AnVIL is a good choice for your class. We feel the answer is an unequivocal YES! AnVIL provides all the advantages of a cloud computing environment: Version control: All students will be using the exact same versions of programs, running on the exact same operating system, and the majority of setup can be handled for the students ahead of time. This greatly reduces time spent on setup and prevents unexpected run errors during the activities, limiting the amount of troubleshooting you have to do. As a result, classes and activities will run more smoothly and predictably. Inclusivity: Cloud-computing enables all students to participate in the activity without needing to provide computers with certain specifications. Experience: Cloud-computing is becoming common in today’s bioinformatics workplaces, and the classroom is a low-stress and low-stakes opportunity for students to gain experience. AnVIL is purpose-built for genomic data science: Tools: Through AnVIL, students can access a wide range of tools (Galaxy, RStudio/Bioconductor, Jupyter, as well as scripted workflows) all in one place, and can easily transition between them. Datasets: AnVIL provides a large and growing collection of relevant datasets with standardized organization, for easier importing and processing. Authenticity: On AnVIL, students will be working in the same environment as scientists carrying out cutting edge research.
