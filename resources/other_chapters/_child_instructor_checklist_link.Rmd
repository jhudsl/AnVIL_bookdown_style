Here is a [checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HqQqH_qlkHwRua8-b92MyKQcEmcl0Nk37rSYqP49aw/edit) to help you keep track of the steps for setting up and teaching on AnVIL. Details about each of these steps can be found in the [AnVIL Instructor Guide](https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_Instructor_Guide).  *Note that this checklist is written for workshop instructors as well as classroom instructors, so some of the "Event Setup" steps may not be applicable to you, depending on your teaching context.*
