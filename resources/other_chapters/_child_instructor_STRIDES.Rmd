If you are new to AnVIL, **we strongly recommend seeking funding through NHGRI / STRIDES for teaching your course**.  In order to prevent abuse, Google sets certain limits on cloud resources available to new users that can complicate teaching (e.g. [project quotas](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/6101030164507-When-workspace-creation-fails-Google-project-quotas)).  As you or your institution builds a payment history with Google, the limits on your accounts will be relaxed.  In the meantime, STRIDES funding can help ensure your initial classes run smoothly.

**What is STRIDES?**  NHGRI's [strategic vision](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33116284/) highlights the importance of training the next generation of genomic scientists.  In collaboration with the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy, NHGRI makes funding available to AnVIL users through the [STRIDES](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides) program, which aims to promote biological research in cloud environments.
