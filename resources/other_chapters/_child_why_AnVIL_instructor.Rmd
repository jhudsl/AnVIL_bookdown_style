You may be wondering if AnVIL is a good choice for your class. We feel the answer is an unequivocal YES!

AnVIL provides all the advantages of a cloud computing environment:

- **Version control**:  All students will be using the exact same versions of programs, running on the exact same operating system, and the majority of setup can be handled for the students ahead of time.  This greatly reduces time spent on setup and prevents unexpected run errors during the activities, limiting the amount of troubleshooting you have to do.  As a result, classes and activities will run more smoothly and predictably.
- **Inclusivity**: Cloud-computing enables all students to participate in the activity without needing to provide computers with certain specifications.
- **Experience**: Cloud-computing is becoming common in todayâ€™s bioinformatics workplaces, and the classroom is a low-stress and low-stakes opportunity for students to gain experience.

AnVIL is purpose-built for genomic data science:

- **Tools**: Through AnVIL, students can access a wide range of tools (Galaxy, RStudio/Bioconductor, Jupyter, as well as scripted workflows) all in one place, and can easily transition between them.
- **Datasets**: AnVIL provides a large and growing collection of relevant datasets with standardized organization, for easier importing and processing.
- **Authenticity**: On AnVIL, students will be working in the same environment as scientists carrying out cutting edge research.
